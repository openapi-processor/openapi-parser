== openapi-parser-validator

A dependency-less java 8 based JSON Schema validator with pluggable json parser.

Used by openapi-parser but also usable as standalone JSON Schema validator.

== supported JSON Schema versions

It is tested against the official link:{json-schema-testsuite}[JSON Schema Test Suite].

=== Draft4 => OpenAPI 3.0.x

It passes all draft 4 tests & all *optional* draft 4 tests except

* `draft4/optional/ecmascript-regex.json`
+
the validator passes *51* of *74* tests.
+
It doesn't pass all tests because `java.util.regex` doesn't support the full ECMA 262 regular expression dialect.

* `draft4/optional/format/date-time.json`
+
the validator passes *23* of *25* tests.
+
The two failing tests use leap seconds which are not supported by `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter`.
