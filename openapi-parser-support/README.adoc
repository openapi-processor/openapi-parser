== openapi-parser-support

a small library with shared code of the link:{parser}[parser] and the link:{validator}[validator].

Contains two simple `Reader` implementations:

* `UriReader`: read link:{openapi}[OpenAPI] descriptions from an URI. Based on `java.net.URL`. No security at the moment.
* `StringReader`: read an link:{openapi}[OpenAPI] description from a string. Used in the test code.
